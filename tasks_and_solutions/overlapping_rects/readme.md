# Overlapping Rects

One day I was asked during a code inteview to solve a practical task that I completed partially. 
Here is the task and attempt to solve it again.

## Task

Given 2 rectangles with top left coordinates, width and height. Find if these 
rectangles are overlapping.

## Testing

```
mypy --strict solution.py
python -m unittest tests.py
```
